### Written by Alastair Cota

To get started, install LoopMIDI and create a MIDI port named "DJHero".  
Enable the virtual MIDI port in your DJ Software or DAW.  
Then run DJHero-x64.exe or compile it manually using Visual Studio 2017.  
Connect your controller to your PC with an Xbox 360 Wireless Adapter for Windows.
